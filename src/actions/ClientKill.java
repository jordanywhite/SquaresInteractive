 * ClientKill
 * 
 * NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
 *
 * Have the server keep track of how long it has been since it has received messages
 * from clients. If that time reaches a timeout, send a KillMessage to the client.
 * If the client responds back saying "Don't Kill Me!" then reset the timer.
 * If the client does not respond in a certain period of time, kill the connection.
