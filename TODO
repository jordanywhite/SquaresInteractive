remove player when someone disconnects
fix sending init player position to client
if client jumps, server thinks they're moving (temp fix by disabling spacebar?)
update server player position on move request (currently server position never changes)
init messages do not change so when new player/connection added, it's using the starting position in the init message
send player facing-direction in INIT msgs
when moving up or right with 2nd+ player, facing-direction is desynchronized b/w server and clients
	NOTE: this could be because of init message crappiness
Synchronizing issues between clients and server (interactions destabilize environment)
